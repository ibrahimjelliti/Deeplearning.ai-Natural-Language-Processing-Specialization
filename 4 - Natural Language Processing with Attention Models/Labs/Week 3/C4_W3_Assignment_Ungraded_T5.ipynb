The Safavid Era saw the start of mass integration from Caucasian populations into new layers of the society of Iran , as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran , playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards . Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and early 1700s , which was caused by the internal conflicts , the continuous wars with the Ottomans , and the foreign interference ( most notably the Russian interference ) , the Safavid rule was ended by the Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan and defeated Soltan Hosein in 1722 . \n",

# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to NLP Specialization. I created this repo to collect all notes and summary on this brand-new specialization from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)

## Getting Started
I made the repo structure same as the course, each numbred-folder is a course. 
under each course folder, you find a readme file contains the summary on all course weeks with pictures and in simple way.
Labs and assignments of each week are under the lab folder with all its dependencies, so you can run it on your local Jupyter server.
I added several docs and code issues you can contribute at the repo [Issues](https://github.com/ijelliti/Deeplearning.ai-Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization/issues)
All the contributions are done via GitHub.
